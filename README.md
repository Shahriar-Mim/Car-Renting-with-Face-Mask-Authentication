# Car-Renting-with-Face-Mask-Authentication
This is a college project for my CSE491(Mobile Programming Course)
Car Rental Services request their clients to wear face-mask but they can not guaranty it. So, thinking about this problem I have built an Android App which ensures through the help of **Machine Learning Face Mask Detection Algorithm** an user has to wear a face mask for renting a car.  
Details Demonstration of this project is available in this video: https://youtu.be/0vuXp_xf0bY
